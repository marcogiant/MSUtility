What the project does
- 
OVERVIEW Mid-side (MS) processing is a special method of processing stereo signals. The purpose of MS processing is to decompose a stereo signal into different parts. It allows to apply different processing to the MID (central pan image) and to SIDE (L/R part of the image) individually, most commonly EQ and Compression.


Why the project is useful
- 
When using MS processing, a conventional stereo signal with a left channel and right channel is separated into a mid channel and a sides channel. This way it is possible to equalize or compress the sounds in the center of a mix independently of the sounds on the sides.

How users can get started with the project
- 
One simple use of MS processing is to perform stereo image widening. 

MS processing requires two steps: 
encoding and decoding.
Therefor, it takes 2 mono signals = x = left channel Y = right channel MS processing does not actually change the signal. However, it is meant to be used with other processing like equalization or compression.

Who maintains and contributes to the project
- 

A README should contain only the necessary information for developers to get started using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is best suited for wikis. For more information, see "About wikis."
