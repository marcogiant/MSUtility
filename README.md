Mid-side (M/S) processing is a special technique for manipulating stereo signals.
This project filters a stereo signal (or M/S) in two different, complementing bands and allows M/S processing to be applied to each bin independently.

The project can be downloaded by anyone and any suggestion is welcome.
Likewise beyond the extensive list of information available on the internet, feel free to reach out for any further explanation on how to get you started with the project!
